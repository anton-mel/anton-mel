Hi, I am a rising junior at Yale University (F1-visa; OPT/CPT work eligibility) from Ukraine, studying Computer Systems Design. My current workload is based on Principles of Computer Systems Design and Building Distributed Systems. Additionally, I am conducting research at the Efficient Computing Lab, where I am studying TheseusOS.
