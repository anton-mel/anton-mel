### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Anton, an undergraduate student at Yale University from Ukraine. I am majoring in Computer Science with a Computer Vision track, as well as taking Data Science and Japanese Certificates. My coursework is built on core CS, operating systems (CPSC 323), artificial intelligence, proof-based algorithms (CPSC 365), databases design. Beyond software development, I am takign Research Methods in Astrophysics (PHYS 295), which invloved Python computational manipulation of digitized images and scientific package writing. I am also part of Technology & Research Scholars (STARS) at Yale, and intend to do research in asteroseismology with Computer Vision algorithms the following semester. I primarily work with this stack/skills: Python, Debuggers, OOP, C, C++, Algorithms, Angular, ReactJS, NextJS, Typescript, React Native, ThreeJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, Prisma, PHP, MySQL, Docker, Bash, Git, Tailwind, Bootstrap, Figma, VS Code, HTML, CSS, Less, Blender. I quickly adapt to new technologies (including languages) and am always eager to learn something new!
