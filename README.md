Hi, I am a rising senior at Yale University, studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I grew up chasing grasshoppers in a small farming village in Ukraine. Currently, I conduct research at the Efficient Computing Lab. I spend a lot of time studying Japanese language and history. Talk to me on Element: https://matrix.to/#/@an.tony:matrix.org.
