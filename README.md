Hi, I am a rising junior at Yale University from Ukraine, studying Computer Systems Design. Currently I focus on GPOS/RTOS, computer vision, and GPT-driven drones. Previously a musician and guitarist, I have a small YouTube channel for my covers and arrangements. Feel free to reach out to me via anton.melnychuk3@gmail.com
